(N x N) size of world
benchmark with
- 2 threads, 3 threads, 4 th, 5 th, 6 th, 8 th etc

vary the values of N also to prove that more threads increases performance at any grid size ie N = 40, 80, 160


compare time with number of threads

Include number of cores used, type of chipset etseteraaah, etseteraaaah.
